## React Vidz

This is a course project for [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/)

This is a small, one page site that will load up a few Youtube Videos based on user specified search terms.
The videos are rendered out in a nice looking, user friendly way.

To run this project, simply:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

This project is fairly basic.
Along with showcasing proper project structure, as well as good syntactical practice, and compartmentalized components that 
are effective and easily reusable in new locations, this project also touches on a few other basic React practices. Practices like 
conditional rendering, and passing props to children and grandchildren.
